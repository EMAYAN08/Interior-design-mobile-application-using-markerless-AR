Augmented Reality(AR) is a domain of research which deals with mixture of reality with computer
associated data. It is an atmosphere that concerns between
virtual reality and real circumstances. AR has been a broadly explored technology in various domains, it is also consistently utilized in civil engineering, architecture, and interior
design experimentation. For interior designers and people
who would like to decorate their rooms, being able to think
in three dimensions and visualizing projects is of great importance. In an augmented reality ecosystem, digital furniture could be arranged and controlled in the real world in
real time which permits the customer to have a synergetic
experience. In huge pace being created in digital technology
that virtual design hasn't keystoned productively. Our mobile application could resolve this by allowing customers to
percieve at a 3D furnished prototype - a digital similarity of
the real world appliances with no intrusion of the symbols.
Our mobile application operates on three primary augmented reality features i.e Motion tracking, environmental
understanding, light estimation. This implementation will
assist the client to percieve and feel the appliance in the
existing surrounding prior buying it from the producer
